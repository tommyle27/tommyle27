print('What is "program"?')
#answers the question
print('''A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a 
computation. The details look different in different languages, but a 
few basic instructions appear in just about every language: 

input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or 
other device.

math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition 
and multiplication.

conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute 
the appropriate code.
repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.''')
#conclusion
print("Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it")
#Origin of the algebra/Algorithm
print('''A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. The word
"algorithm" derives from the name of the mathematician, al-khwarizmi, who
was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 
850. Al-Khwarizmi's work is the likely source for the word algebra
as well''')
